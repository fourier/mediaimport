# Media Import
Media Import is a simple OSX utility for copying images(and other files) according to their timestamps. It is implemented with LispWorks 7.0 for OSX.
![example](https://github.com/fourier/mediaimport/raw/screenshots/screenshot1.png "Example")

## Features
- It verifies if there are already files with the suggested names, and if there are, skip if they are identical or suggest another name;
- Allows to search by file mask like "\*.png, \*.jpg";
- Allows to look in subdirectories;
- Rename according to the pattern, where one can specify subdirectories and files using template declarations like {yyyy} for years;
- Allows to get timestamp from EXIF data for JPEG files
